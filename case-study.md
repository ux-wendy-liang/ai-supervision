| Time to prototype | **4 weeks** (vs. 3-4 months traditional) |
| Validated model | Based on SimCare AI's **$4M ARR** success |

## The Story

### 1. The Spark

I discovered a paradox in the coaching industry:

> **Coaches help others grow, but struggle to grow themselves.**

Why? Supervision costs **$150-300/hour**. Most coaches can only afford it once a month. By the time they discuss a difficult client case, it's already weeks old.

**Then I found SimCare AI** — a YC-backed startup letting therapy students practice with AI patients. $4.5M raised. $4M revenue. 70+ universities.

**My insight:** *No one was doing this for coaches.*

### 2. The Opportunity

I mapped the market and found a clear gap:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    MARKET MAP                           │

│                                                         │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Target users:** 71,000+ ICF-certified coaches, especially trainees and new coaches who are price-sensitive and practice-hungry.

### 3. The Strategy

I had to solve a positioning challenge:

> AI can't replace human supervision (ICF won't count AI hours). So how do we create value?

**My decision:** Position as a **practice tool**, not a replacement.

| What We Are | What We're Not |
|-------------|----------------|
| Unlimited practice reps | Certification credit |
| Instant feedback | Human judgment |
| Safe space to fail | Performance review |

---

### 4. The Solution

Two complementary features:

**Feature A: Simulate Practice**
Practice with AI clients anytime. Get real-time feedback based on ICF standards.

**Feature B: Session Review**
Upload real sessions. Get AI-powered analysis and growth tracking.

---

### 5. Key Design Decisions

**Decision 1: Real-time feedback sidebar**

*Challenge:* How to give feedback without disrupting conversation flow?

*Solution:* Collapsible sidebar with live stats (talk ratio, question quality, empathy moments). Coach can glance without breaking flow.

*Why:* Borrowed from Poised app — their real-time private feedback is the killer feature.

**Decision 2: ICF-grounded assessment**

*Challenge:* How to make AI feedback feel credible to skeptical coaches?

*Solution:* Structure all feedback around ICF's official 8 Core Competencies. Include definitions, timestamps, specific examples.

*Why:* Coaches already know this framework. It's the industry standard.

**Decision 3: Persona variety with difficulty levels**

*Challenge:* How to keep practice engaging and progressive?

*Solution:* 6 distinct client personas (career anxiety, leadership, burnout, etc.) with Beginner → Advanced difficulty.

*Why:* Variety prevents boredom. Progression supports skill-building.

## Reflection

### What I'd explore next
- Voice interface (coaching is conversational)
- Mobile experience for on-the-go review
- AI fine-tuning on real coaching transcripts

### Why AI-assisted design matters
This project would typically take a cross-functional team 3-4 months: market research, competitive analysis, user research synthesis, design exploration, prototyping.

I did it in **4 weeks** by leveraging AI as a research partner and design accelerator — while maintaining the strategic thinking that only a human designer can provide.
